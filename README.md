## Professional Summary

Skilled (and opinionated) LAMP stack developer with over 20 years of experience working with PHP, MySQL, HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS, alongside AWS-based hosting. I enjoy planning—or perhaps controlling—all aspects of the development and deployment process. I've led small development teams responsible for designing, releasing, and maintaining web applications, as well as managing full-stack development solo. I thrive in small, collaborative teams with high responsibility and autonomy, and have 16 years of experience working remotely.

As a team lead, I place immense importance on both the mental health and education of my team members. My goal is to foster a supportive, productive environment while managing project expectations so that both team wellbeing and business goals are met sustainably. A productive team is not a burnt-out team.

As a developer and designer, I lean toward open source technologies—particularly Linux and PHP—as my preferred tools for back-end development. That said, I believe in using the right tool for the job rather than adhering rigidly to any one language or framework. I’m thoughtful about which third-party libraries or frameworks to adopt, choosing based on long-term maintainability and suitability rather than trends. While I’ve dabbled in Python and Node, I don’t typically reach for them as my first choice. As a full stack developer, I care deeply about both the functionality and the visual polish of an application—things should look good as well as work well.
